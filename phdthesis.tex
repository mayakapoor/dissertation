\appendix

\chapter{QUADRATIC FIT COMPARISON GRAPHS}

The appendices should be used for whatever material you or your advisory
committee believes should be included, but would not be appropriate
in the text of the thesis or dissertation. Such materials can include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the original data obtained in the thesis or dissertation research,
including computer programs and printouts, surveys, or correspondence;
\item detailed descriptions of procedures, which go beyond the general outline
of methods and approaches presented in the text;
\item a particularly extensive review of the literature and other information
that may be useful to future scholars who may wish to delve more deeply
into the research topic.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Section in appendix}

This is a section in the appendix.
