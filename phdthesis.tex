\begin{abstract}
The real, complex network environment consists of an ever-increasingly diverse and
large amount of data encapsulated in packets. Surveillance and monitoring of this
traffic is a necessary task for law enforcement, cybersecurity, and intelligence
agencies. Intercepted network traffic must be classified into multiple categories,
such as the protocol encapsulation layers contained, application it originates from,
user generating the traffic, and the traffic's malicious or benign nature. There is a
lack of solutions which are able to classify packets individually without flow-based
features. In order to address the gaps in current traffic classification and DPI
techniques, we propose the initial release of the \textsc{Forager} toolkit, a software
consisting of tools to extract hidden representations from individual packets and use
these features in deep learning models to perform traffic classification. It uses data
 mining techniques to perform automatic generation of regular expression signatures,
locality-sensitive hash fingerprints, and matrix and point cloud representations of
packets. These are used as input features for corresponding deep learning models which
 can perform traffic classification on single packets in a real system. The models are
 multi-modal to capture multiple angles and dimensions of features for increased
complexity of classification problems. They can be run in parallel for optimal
throughput and scalability. Our experiments use these models in multiple
configurations and scenarios to demonstrate superior performance and classification
capability to advance the state of the art in complex network traffic surveillance and
 hidden representation learning.
