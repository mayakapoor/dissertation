This work proposes a new system of data mining and deep learning for network traffic classification at scale. The \textsc{Forager} system includes models which contribute both novel application of data transformation techniques which unveil hidden representations as well as machine learning models applied in real systems. We propose a method for extracting data from PCAPs and converting them to tabular format, then transforming them appropriately according to what we have learned from previous experiments. For example, plaintext, strongly signatured data which we are aiming to identify by protocol (SIP, HTTP, POP) may be aptly suited for regular expression generation algorithms. Alternatively, weakly signatured data may be run with the \textsc{Maple} model for payload analysis and \textsc{Alpine} model for header features for identification. Similarly for profiling, encrypted data may also be well-suited for the \textsc{Alpine} and \textsc{Maple} model combination. Our ensemble voting system allows for this multimodal analysis and can finally be saved and returned through a tagging system implemented in the original data. Thus, our toolkit will be a useful contribution to network analysts and cybersecurity and surveillance specialists for uniquely identifying traffic on the internet today.
