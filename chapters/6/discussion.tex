\section{Discussion and Limitations}

Of the models tested so far in this work, \textsc{Date} is the most computationally complex with the lowest throughput. In future work, we propose implementing multi-threading and multi-core processing as potential optimizations. We observed that point cloud generation was a pain point for the system in terms of cycles, and consider offloading such repetitive calculations to a specialized hardware such as FPGA~\cite{Song2005EfficientPC} when available in the deployed system. Because \textsc{Maple} is able to normalize data and map it into a three-dimensional cluster space, it would be well-suited to heterogeneous data such as sensor data combined with packet data from an Internet of Things (IoT) device. This would create a multi-embedding capable of correlating these data inputs for machine learning tasks. Simpler problems may be solved with more na√Øve approaches such as regular expression matching on plaintext SIP traffic, or using the locality-sensitive hashing strategy toward device fingerprinting.

We propose both \textsc{Maple} and \textsc{Date} as potential methods for generating hidden, latent-space representations of traffic as their capabilities extend to different problem areas. \textsc{Maple} works well on input data such as a payload which may be distinct one data sample from another, but can be divided and matricized into units for comparison (i.e. turned into a grayscale image of uniform dimension). On the other hand, \textsc{Date} has the potential to expand to include other non-network features and represent more heterogenous data. For example, input sensor data from IoT devices or light detection and ranging (LiDAR) equipment have used DBSCAN for data processing and normalization~\cite{wanglidar2019}; it could be combined with cloud/network data inputs as an additional embedding model for classification problems. While for the RTP problem \textsc{Maple} provides high accuracy with more efficiency than \textsc{Date}, there is a trade-off within the embedding space as \textsc{Date} may be able to represent data of higher complexity in other problems for future work.
