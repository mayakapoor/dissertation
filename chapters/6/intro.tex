\section{Introduction}

While image generation and matrix representation expand packet data to two-dimensional space, we wanted to explore other geometric representations of data and deepen the dimensionality. In geometric topology, point clouds are another way to generate data shapes for anomaly detection and comparison. For this purpose, we designed \textsc{Date}, a cluster \textbf{D}ensity \textbf{A}nalysis-based \textbf{T}ensor \textbf{E}ncoder model which expands network packets into three dimensional point clouds, which we then extract features of regarding cluster density in order to find commonalities and classify based on data shape. This spatial expansion is a novel application of latent representation learning to network traffic and the problem of RTP detection or detecting weakly signatured traffic and could expand to other protocol problems.
