 abstract = {Packet content scanning at high speed has become extremely important due to its applications in network security, network monitoring, HTTP load balancing, etc. In content scanning, the packet payload is compared against a set of patterns specified as regular expressions. In this paper, we first show that memory requirements using traditional methods are prohibitively high for many patterns used in packet scanning applications. We then propose regular expression rewrite techniques that can effectively reduce memory usage. Further, we develop a grouping scheme that can strategically compile a set of regular expressions into several engines, resulting in remarkable improvement of regular expression matching speed without much increase in memory usage. We implement a new DFA-based packet scanner using the above techniques. Our experimental results using real-world traffic and patterns show that our implementation achieves a factor of 12 to 42 performance improvement over a commonly used DFA-based scanner. Compared to the state-of-art NFA-based implementation, our DFA-based packet scanner achieves 50 to 700 times speedup.},

Although there are notable efforts to classify darknet traffic which rely heavily on existing datasets and machine learning classifiers, there are extremely few efforts to detect and characterize darknet traffic using deep learning. This work proposes a novel approach, named DeepImage, which uses feature selection to pick the most important features to create a gray image and feed it to a two-dimensional convolutional neural network to detect and characterize darknet traffic. Two encrypted traffic datasets are merged to create a darknet dataset to evaluate the proposed approach which successfully characterizes darknet traffic with 86% accuracy.},
